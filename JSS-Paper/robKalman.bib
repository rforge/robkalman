@book{Ri94,
        author={Rieder, Helmut},
        title={{Robust asymptotic statistics}},
        abstract={{This book is about optimally robust functionals and their unbiased estimators
                and tests. Functionals extend the parameter of the assumed ideal center
                model to neighborhoods of this model that contain the actual distribution.
                The two principal questions are (F): Which functional to choose? and (P):
                Which statistical procedure to use for the selected functional? Using a
                local asymptotic framework, we deal with both problems by linking up nonparametric
                statistical optimality with infinitesimal robustness criteria. Thus, seemingly
                separate developments in robust statistics are presented in a unifying
                way.\par Instead of principles, we prefer objective criteria that are applicable
                to a wide class of functionals. Moreover, we look more closely into the
                nonparametric optimality theorems, whose proofs completely rely on the
                parametric results applied to one least favorable local alternative. It
                is true that these abstract theorems are geared to, and are to some extent
                justified by, the utmost generality. As a side condition on mathematical
                abstraction, however, elementary procedures should still be dealt with
                according to original intentions. But for the class of asymptotically linear
                estimators, it turns out that the asymptotic statistical optimality results,
                which -- in the parametric case -- generalize the Cramer-Rao bound for
                asymptotic variance, are -- in the nonparametric setup with full neighborhoods
                -- dominated by bias alone:\par To be able to trace the proofs of the nonparametric
                optimality theorems, and because a sufficiently lucid and elementary reference
                on asymptotic statistics (in particular, on the asymptotic minimax theorem)
                has been lacking, it proved necessary to develop a self-contained treatment
                of the main statistical optimality results. Our presentation is fairly
                simple (assuming only weak convergence), so that students with a basic
                knowledge of probability and statistics can understand the proofs. As such,
                the corresponding Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6 (supported by Appendix A) should
                be interesting also outside robust statistics. Chapter 1, a nonstatistical
                extra, merely supplies some asymptotically normal procedures via differentiation.\par
                In the sequel, the nonparametric optimality results are used in just two
                ways: First, as unbiasedness statements, and secondly, to quantify the
                costs at which any functional can be estimated or tested. On this basis,
                we then determine that functional which, subject to certain robustness
                constraints, is easiest to estimate or test. As robustness side conditions,
                bounds are imposed on the infinitesimal oscillation (estimation), respectively,
                the inclusion of given capacity balls into nonparametric hypotheses is
                required (testing). It is at this instance where the classical robustness
                theories on bias and variance may be invoked to complement nonparametric
                unbiasedness by some further, nontrivial, optimality.\par Optimality results
                for general parameters are contained in Chapter 5. Chapter 7 derives those
                for linear regression, which serves as a prototype example of a structured
                model, where additional variants of neighborhoods and optimality problems
                arise. The conditional centering constraint occurring in this context takes
                values in some infinite-dimensional function space, and makes it necessary
                to explicitly derive a suitable Lagrange multiplier theorem [Appendix B].
                We must admit that the monolithic type of optimality known from parametric
                statistics cannot be achieved in robust statistics. The solutions depend
                on the choice of neighborhoods, and one hardly knows precisely what sort
                of neighborhood one would `like to be robust over'. But the variety of
                robust solutions at least constitute a complete class.\par The book has
                no pretensions of treating all developments in robustness, nonparametrics,
                or asymptotic statistics. We only consider the local, infinitesimal, approach
                (that is, no qualitative robustness, no breakdown aspects), and only the
                case of independent observations. The restricted selection and comprehensive
                treatment of basic issues, however, defines the framework for further refinements,
                extensions, and specializations.}},

abstract="{``To turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully'' is a
    fundamental goal of $S$, a functional object-based language designed for
    computing with data. $S$ provides organization for data by providing useful
    classes of objects and techniques for storing them in $S$ databases. It also
    provides tools for a wide range of visualization, computation and modeling
    as well as programming, i.e. a language and environment to turn ideas into
    new tools. \par The book consists of eleven chapters plus two appendices.
    The first three chapters survey programming in $S$ with the focus on
    highlights of the main techniques with examples, essential concepts
    underlying all $S$ programming and a quick reference to many tools and
    techniques in $S$. The first chapter of the book introduces the $S$ language
    and programming environment and some of the most common and useful features.
    Topics as using $S$ functions, data, objects and databases as well as
    writing $S$ functions and defining classes and methods are covered there and
    illustrated with the help of a number of examples. \par In the second
    chapter key concepts of $S$ are presented. After sections devoted to the
    relation between $S$ and other languages and user interface to $S$ concepts
    of objects, databases and chapters, functions, methods, classes of objects
    and interfaces are introduced and explained. The third chapter serves as a
    quick reference to a large number of functions, classes and methods provided
    by $S$. \par In the rest of the book various aspects of programming in $S$
    are discussed. Chapter four deals with computations in $S$ while in chapter
    five objects, databases and chapters are described in more details. In
    chapter six general approach to programming in $S$ is discussed including
    debugging and error-handling and programming the user interface. Then, in
    chapters seven and eight more details on dealing with classes and methods
    are presented. Chapter nine describes how to use and develop online
    documentation for $S$ functions, classes and methods. It must be stressed
    that the chapter discusses viewing documentation from $S$ itself even if
    this is only one aspect of a richer documentation programming environment.
    Chapter ten provides details on the tools to handle connections of $S$
    processes to other entities in the computing environment for the purpose of
    reading or writing data. Finally, chapter eleven describes interface
    functions to other languages, namely to the command shell and to subroutines
    written in C, C++, or Fortran. \par Two appendices provide some special
    information on using $S$. Appendix A deals with the basics of writing C code
    capable of manipulating $S$ objects. In appendix B steps needed to use
    functions and objects created in older versions of $S$ are discussed. \par
    The book can be used as a useful guide to the complete $S$ programming
    process, from simple interactive use through ambitious software projects.}",

abstract="{Preliminary review / Publisher's description: John Chambers has been
    the principal designer of the S language since its beginning, and in 1999
    received the ACM System Software award for S, the only statistical software
    to receive this award. He is author or coauthor of the landmark books on S.

 Now he turns to R, the enormously successful open-source system based on
    the S language. R's international support and the thousands of packages and
    other contributions have made it the standard for statistical computing in
    research and teaching.

 This book guides the reader through programming
    with R, beginning with simple interactive use and progressing by gradual
    stages, starting with simple functions. More advanced programming techniques
    can be added as needed, allowing users to grow into software contributors,
    benefiting their careers and the community. R packages provide a powerful
    mechanism for contributions to be organized and communicated.

 The
    techniques covered include such modern programming enhancements as classes
    and methods, namespaces, and interfaces to spreadsheets or data bases, as
    well as computations for data visualization, numerical methods, and the use
    of text data.}",
